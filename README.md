# About Dataset
This dataset contains data from the top-ranked 250 Korean Dramas as per the MyDramaList website. The data has been collected and uploaded in the form of a CSV file and can be used to work on various Data Science Projects. 

The CSV file has 17 columns and 251 rows containing mostly textual data.  

Most of the data were collected from the MyDramaList website (https://mydramalist.com), and the data for the names of Production Companies was collected from Wikipedia (https://www.wikipedia.org). I wasn't sure how to scrape the data at the time, and hence I went all manual; copying and pasting the data using the cursor. (Yes it was very tedious to manually copy and paste the data!)

I was working on a Content-based Recommender System for Korean Dramas and I needed data to work with. The datasets available on Kaggle had up to only 100 k-drama titles. Not only that, but quite a few of the features deemed essential were also missing; Synopsis, Tags, Director's name, Cast names, Production Companies' names, and such data weren't available with the pre-existing datasets.
